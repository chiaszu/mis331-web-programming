        <p>
          The Natural History Museum reminds me of the movie - "Night at The
          Museum" - since there is also an enormus dinosaur skeleton in the hall
          of the museum. This museum includes a wide arrange of themes, and it's
          definitely worth it to spend time with friends here.

        <p>
          As a world-known scenery spot, London Eye owns its reputation. I enjoy
          the chilling vibe with my friends while strolling along the Thames.
          The sky becomes extremely stunning when it's close to evening. Don't
          miss the ride on the London Eye. You could definitely discover the
          beautiful city views from the top of the ferris wheel!

        <p>
          Tate Modern is a must-vist for art enthusiasts. Especially for those
          who loves the style of Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali.
          Walking through the Millennial Bridge, and voilla, it's Tate Modern!
