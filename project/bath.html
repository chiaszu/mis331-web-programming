        <p>
          Bath is a city located in the county of Somerest, England. It is
          knowned for its Roman-built baths. Many visitors came here for a
          one-day tour of Bath and the Stonehenge. I think it is pretty cool to
          see the roman baths built hundreds years ago.

        <p>
          To enter the Roman Baths, you have to buy the ticket first. Inside the
          building, you can see many handicrafts made hundreds years ago. You
          can also get an audio guide, which will tell you the history of the
          Roman Baths in detail.

        <p>
          I am still in doubt whether the Stonehenge is built by human or by
          aliens. Originally, I thought the piles of the stones would be
          gigantic; however, it did not turned out as what I've been imagining
          for the whole time. It's smaller in size, but it's still great to see
          this wonder in person. By the way, you have to take a shuttle bus to
          arrive the Stonehenge. There are many hays on the side of the road.
